                    <h1 class="h2">Summary</h1>
                    <p><strong>Passionate UX Engineer | Design Systems Advocate | Accessibility Champion</strong><br/>I'm committed to creating inclusive and user-centered experiences. With over 13 years in front-end development, I approach design systems with a comprehensive mindset, ensuring they meet users' needs and are scalable and accessible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technical skills</strong><br/>Proficient in Web Components, Storybook, Style Dictionary, Figma, and Microsoft FAST. I also really love working with CSS.</p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Accessibility champion</strong><br/>Passionate about making technology accessible to everyone. I'm knowledgeable in WCAG guidelines and committed to implementing inclusive design practices. I believe in crafting digital experiences that empower users of all abilities and that it's not enough to meet standards; we must go above and beyond current web standards to ensure we're doing everything possible with the tools we have today.</p>
                        
                    <p><strong>Collaboration is key</strong><br/>I work closely with cross-functional teams to learn something new and deliver value for our customers. Embracing a continuous learning mindset, I seek new problem-solving approaches and feedback to grow.</p>
                        
                    <p><strong>What's next?</strong><br/>I am excited by the opportunities to integrate AI with design systems, from helping teams adopt to creating new experiences. Feel free to reach out for discussions on design systems, accessibility best practices, or anything UX-related.</p>
